# Caches

Caches is an asynchronous version of local storage, hence can be used within service workers. Caches contains a number of named Cache objects. A cache is used to store request and response objects.

## Lifetime

A cache is managed by the author. Creating, updating, expiration and deletion is completely managed by the author, not by the browser.
